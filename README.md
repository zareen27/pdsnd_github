### Bikeshare Project

## Description
The program prompts for user input in the form of year, month and day and displays statistics of relevant bikeshares in New York, Chicago and Washington data. 
Where only year specified, it would show year-long data. 
Where year, month and day specified it will return data accordingly. 
The user can also view 4 type of statistics:
 - Time Statistics: e.g., Most frequent Travel times and most Common month and tour from requested trip data. 
 - Station Statistics: e.g., Most frequent combination of start and end station. 
 - Trip Statistics: e.g., Mean travel time in requested trip data. 
 - User Statistics: e.g., Youngest/Elderly user in requested trip data
